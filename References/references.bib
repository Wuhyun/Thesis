abstract = {The simplest inflationary models present us with few observable parameters to discriminate between them. A detection of features in the spectra of primordial density perturbations could provide valuable insights and lead to stringent tests of models of the early Universe. So far, searches for oscillatory features have not produced statistically significant results. In this work we consider a combined search for features in the power spectrum and bispectrum. We show that possible dependencies between the estimates of feature model amplitudes based on the two- and three-point correlators are largely statistically independent under the assumption of the null hypothesis of a nearly Gaussian featureless CMB. Building on this conclusion we propose an optimal amplitude estimator for a combined search and study the look-elsewhere effect in feature model surveys. In particular we construct analytic models for the distribution of amplitude estimates that allow for a reliable assessment of the significance of potential findings. We also propose a well-behaved integrated statistic that is designed to detect evidence for models exhibiting features at multiple frequencies.},

@article{PlanckCollaboration2015,
abstract = {The Planck full mission cosmic microwave background(CMB) temperature and E-mode polarization maps are analysed to obtain constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity(NG). Using three classes of optimal bispectrum estimators - separable template-fitting (KSW), binned, and modal - we obtain consistent values for the local, equilateral, and orthogonal bispectrum amplitudes, quoting as our final result from temperature alone fNL{\^{}}local=2.5+$\backslash$-5.7, fNL{\^{}}equil=-16+$\backslash$-70 and fNL{\^{}}ortho=-34+$\backslash$-33(68{\%}CL). Combining temperature and polarization data we obtain fNL{\^{}}local=0.8+$\backslash$-5.0, fNL{\^{}}equil=-4+$\backslash$-43 and fNL{\^{}}ortho=-26+$\backslash$-21 (68{\%}CL). The results are based on cross-validation of these estimators on simulations, are stable across component separation techniques, pass an extensive suite of tests, and are consistent with Minkowski functionals based measurements. The effect of time-domain de-glitching systematics on the bispectrum is negligible. In spite of these test outcomes we conservatively label the results including polarization data as preliminary, owing to a known mismatch of the noise model in simulations and the data. Beyond fNL estimates, we present model-independent reconstructions of the CMB bispectrum and derive constraints on early universe scenarios that generate NG, including general single-field and axion inflation, initial state modifications, parity-violating tensor bispectra, and directionally dependent vector models. We also present a wide survey of scale-dependent oscillatory bispectra, and we look for isocurvature NG. Our constraint on the local primordial trispectrum amplitude is gNL{\^{}}local=(-9.0+$\backslash$-7.7)x10{\^{}}4 (68{\%}CL), and we perform an analysis of additional trispectrum shapes. The global picture is one of consistency with the premises of the LambdaCDM cosmology, namely that the structure we observe today was sourced by adiabatic, passive, Gaussian, and primordial seed perturbations.[abridged]},

abstract = {We use a separable mode expansion estimator with WMAP data to estimate the bispectrum for all the primary families of non-Gaussian models. We review the late-time mode expansion estimator methodology which can be applied to any non-separable primordial and CMB bispectrum model, and we demonstrate how the method can be used to reconstruct the CMB bispectrum from an observational map. We extend the previous validation of the general estimator using local map simulations. We apply the estimator to the coadded WMAP 5-year data, reconstructing the WMAP bispectrum using {\$}l{\textless}500{\$} multipoles and {\$}n=31{\$} orthonormal 3D eigenmodes. We constrain all popular nearly scale-invariant models, ensuring that the theoretical bispectrum is well-described by a convergent mode expansion. Constraints from the local model {\$} \backslashfnl=54.4\backslashpm 29.4{\$} and the equilateral model {\$}\backslashfnl=143.5\backslashpm 151.2{\$} ({\$}\backslashFnl = 25.1\backslashpm 26.4{\$}) are consistent with previously published results. (Here, we use a nonlinearity parameter {\$}\backslashFnl{\$} normalised to the local case, to allow more direct comparison between different models.) Notable new constraints from our method include those for the constant model {\$}\backslashFnl = 35.1 \backslashpm 27.4 {\$}, the flattened model {\$}\backslashFnl = 35.4\backslashpm 29.2{\$}, and warm inflation {\$}\backslashFnl = 10.3\backslashpm 27.2{\$}. We investigate feature models surveying a wide parameter range in both the scale and phase, and we find no significant evidence of non-Gaussianity in the models surveyed. We propose a measure {\$}\backslashbarFnl{\$} for the total integrated bispectrum and find that the measured value is consistent with the null hypothesis that CMB anisotropies obey Gaussian statistics. We argue that this general bispectrum survey with the WMAP data represents the best evidence for Gaussianity to date and we discuss future prospects, notably from the Planck satellite.},

We show that the CMB can give independent constraints on the amplitude of primordial bispectra of both local and equilateral shape as well as those created by secondary anisotropies.

Second, we implement a bispectrum estimator which is fully optimal in the presence of sky cuts and inhomogeneous noise, extends the generality of fast estimators which have been limited to a few specific forms of the bispectrum, and improves the running time of existing implementations by several orders of magnitude. Third, we give an algorithm for simulating random, weakly non-Gaussian maps with prescribed power spectrum and factorizable bispectrum.},

abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between the dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible with the next generation of experiments. A programm implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

This significance is typically addressed by running a large number of simulations to derive the probability density function (PDF) of the feature-amplitude in the Gaussian case. Although these simulations are tractable for the power spectrum, for the bispectrum they require significant computational resources. We show that, by assuming that the PDF is given by a multivariate Gaussian where the covariance is determined by the Fisher matrix of the sine and cosine terms, we can efficiently produce spectra that are statistically close to those derived from full simulations. By drawing a large number of spectra from this PDF, both for the power spectrum and the bispectrum, we can quickly determine the statistical significance of candidate signatures in the CMB, considering both single frequency and multifrequency estimators. We show that for resonance models, cosmology and foreground parameters have little influence on the estimated amplitude, which allows us to simplify the analysis considerably. A more precise likelihood treatment can then be applied to candidate signatures only. We also discuss a modal expansion approach for the power spectrum, aimed at quickly scanning through large families of oscillating models.},

In the context of multi-field inflation, we detail a mechanism that can create significant primordial non-Gaussianities in the adiabatic mode while preserving the scale invariance of the power spectrum. This mechanism is based on the generation of non-Gaussian isocurvature fluctuations which are then transfered to the adiabatic modes through a bend in the classical inflaton trajectory. Natural realizations involve quartic self-interaction terms for which a full computation can be performed. The expected statistical properties of the resulting metric fluctuations are shown to be the superposition of a Gaussian and a non-Gaussian contribution of the same variance. The relative weight of these two contributions is related to the total bending in field space. We explicit the non-Gaussian probability distribution function which appears to be described by a single new parameter. Only two new parameters therefore suffice in describing the non-Gaussianity.},

This approach allows us to study the effects of features in the power-spectrum and in the bispectrum of curvature perturbations, from a model-independent point of view, by parametrizing the features directly with modified "slow-roll" parameters. We can obtain a self-consistent power-spectrum, together with enhanced non-Gaussianity, which grows with a quantity {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} that parametrizes the sharpness of the step. With this treatment it is straightforward to generalize and include features in other coefficients of the effective action of the inflaton field fluctuations. Our conclusion in this case is that, excluding extrinsic curvature terms, the only interesting effects at the level of the bispectrum could arise from features in the first slow-roll parameter {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} or in the speed of sound {\$}c{\_}s{\$}. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the parameter {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} from the consistency of the perturbative expansion of the action for inflaton perturbations. This constraint can be used for an estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio, to show that the observable which is most sensitive to features is the power-spectrum. This conclusion would change if we consider the contemporary presence of a feature and a speed of sound {\$}c{\_}s {\textless} 1{\$}, as, in such a case, contributions from an oscillating folded configuration can potentially make the bispectrum the leading observable for feature models.},

While there are hints of log spaced resonant features present in the WMAP9 data, the significance of these features weaken with more data. With more accurate small scale measurements, we also find that the best fit frequency has shifted and the amplitude has been reduced. We confirm the presence of a several low frequency peaks, earlier identified by the Planck team, but with a better improvement of fit (delta chi{\^{}}2 {\~{}} 12). We further investigate this improvement by allowing the lensing potential to vary as well, showing mild correlation between the amplitude of the oscillations and the lensing amplitude. We find that the improvement of the fit increases even more (delta chi{\^{}}2 {\~{}} 14) for the low frequencies that modify the spectrum in a way that mimics the lensing effect. Since these features were not present in the WMAP data, they are primarily due to better measurements of Planck at small angular scales. For linear spaced oscillations we find a maximum delta chi{\^{}}2 {\~{}} 13 scanning two orders of magnitude in frequency space, and the biggest improvements are at extremely high frequencies. We recover a best fit frequency very close to the one found in WMAP9, which confirms that the fit improvement is driven by low l. Further comparisons with WMAP9 show Planck contains many more features, both for linear and log space oscillations, but with a smaller improvement of fit. We discuss the improvement as a function of the number of modes and study the effect of the 217 GHz map, which appears to drive most of the improvement for log spaced oscillations.

A wide variety of models predict these features in one of two different flavors: logarithmically spaced oscillations and linearly spaced oscillations. The proposed method treats the oscillations as perturbations on top of the scale-invariant power spectrum, allowing us to vary all cosmological parameters. This perturbative approach reduces the computational requirements for the search as the transfer functions and their derivatives can be precomputed. We show that the most significant degeneracy in the analysis is between the distance to last scattering and the overall amplitude at low frequencies. For models with logarithmic oscillations, this degeneracy leads to an uncertainty in the phase. For linear spaced oscillations, it affects the frequency of the oscillations. In this first of two papers, we test our code on simulated Planck-like data, and show we are able to recover fiducial input oscillations with an amplitude of a few times order 10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}. We apply the code to WMAP9-year data and confirm the existence of two intriguing resonant frequencies for log spaced oscillations. For linear spaced oscillations we find a single resonance peak.

The perturbations to the curvature power spectrum, on the other hand, remain a small component on top of the usual spectrum of fluctuations generated by slow roll.

For the first time, we carry out searches in both the power spectrum and bispectrum simultaneously, employing well-defined look-elsewhere statistics to assess significances in a rigorous manner. Developing efficient methods to scan power spectrum likelihoods for oscillatory features, we present results for the phenomenological bare sine and cosine modulations, allowing validation against existing Planck Likelihood surveys, as well as templates that include the correct sharp feature scaling. In particular, we study degeneracies between feature and cosmological parameters. For frequencies beyond the scale set by the acoustic peaks, the dependencies are realised through uninteresting adjustments of the comoving distance to last scattering. Hence, it is sufficient to keep cosmological parameters fixed and employ fast Gaussian approximations to the likelihood as a function of the feature model amplitude. In cases where results can be compared to the literature, our method shows excellent agreement. We supplement results from the Planck Likelihood with an analysis based on the Planck SMICA component separation map that, working on the assumption that the component separation algorithm is reliable, allows for the inclusion of a larger sky fraction. In principle, this allows us to place the most stringent constraints to date on the amplitudes of feature models in the temperature power spectrum. Invoking the WMAP bispectrum, we perform a combined power spectrum and bispectrum survey. We use and slightly generalise statistics developed in previous work to reliably judge the significance of large feature model amplitude estimates.

The signatures on the power spectrum and bispectrum were previously computed using a slow-roll Fourier transform (SRFT) approximation, and here we compare it with generalized slow roll and in-in methods, for which we derive new formulas that account for moderately sharp features. The agreement between them is excellent, and also with the power spectrum obtained from the numerical solution to the equation of motion. We show that, in this regime, the SRFT approximation correctly captures with simplicity the effect of higher derivatives of the speed of sound in the mode equation, and makes manifest the correlations between power spectrum and bispectrum features. In a previous paper we reported hints of these correlations in the Planck data and here we perform several consistency checks and further analyses of the best fits, such as polarization and local significance at different angular scales. For the data analysis, we show the excellent agreement between the CLASS and CAMB Boltzmann codes.

	abstract = {We use the 7-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) data to place constraints on oscillations supplementing an almost scale-invariant primordial power spectrum. Such oscillations are predicted by a variety of models, some of which amount to assuming that there is some non-trivial choice of the vacuum state at the onset of inflation. In this paper, we will explore data-driven constraints on two distinct models of initial state modifications. In both models, the frequency, phase and amplitude are degrees of freedom of the theory for which the theoretical bounds are rather weak: both the amplitude and frequency have allowed values ranging over several orders of magnitude. This requires many computationally expensive evaluations of the model cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectra and their goodness of fit, even in a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), normally the most efficient fitting method for such a problem. To search more efficiently, we first run a densely-spaced grid, with only three varying parameters: the frequency, the amplitude and the baryon density. We obtain the optimal frequency and run an MCMC at the best-fitting frequency, randomly varying all other relevant parameters. To reduce the computational time of each power spectrum computation, we adjust both comoving momentum integration and spline interpolation (in l) as a function of frequency and amplitude of the primordial power spectrum. Applying this to the WMAP7 data allows us to improve existing constraints on the presence of oscillations. We confirm earlier findings that certain frequencies can improve the fitting over a model without oscillations. For those frequencies we compute the posterior probability, allowing us to put some constraints on the primordial parameter space of both models.},

@article{Hazra2014,
	abstract = {Motivated by the idea that inflation occurs at the GUT symmetry breaking scale, in this paper we construct a new class of large field inflaton potentials where the inflaton starts with a power law potential; after initial period of relative fast roll that lasts until after a few e-folds inside the horizon, it transits to the attractor of the slow roll part of the potential with a lower power. Due to the initial fast roll stages of inflation, we find a suppression in scalar primordial power at large scales and at the same time the choice of the potential can provide us a tensor primordial spectrum with high amplitude. This suppression in scalar power with a large tensor-to-scalar ratio helps us to reconcile the Planck and BICEP2 data in a single framework. We find that a transition from a cubic to quadratic form of inflaton potential generates an appropriate suppression in power of scalar primordial spectrum that provides significant improvement in fit compared to power law model when compared with Planck and BICEP2 data together. We calculate the extent of non-Gaussianity, specifically, the bispectrum for the best fit potential and show that it is consistent with Planck bispectrum constraints.},

@article{Mortonson2009,
	abstract = {The angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy observed by WMAP has an anomalous dip at l{\~{}}20 and bump at l{\~{}}40. One explanation for this structure is the presence of features in the primordial curvature power spectrum, possibly caused by a step in the inflationary potential. The detection of these features is only marginally significant from temperature data alone. However, the inflationary feature hypothesis predicts a specific shape for the E-mode polarization power spectrum with a structure similar to that observed in temperature at l{\~{}}20-40. Measurement of the CMB polarization on few-degree scales can therefore be used as a consistency check of the hypothesis. The Planck satellite has the statistical sensitivity to confirm or rule out the model that best fits the temperature features with 3 sigma significance, assuming all other parameters are known. With a cosmic variance limited experiment, this significance improves to 8 sigma. For tests of inflationary models that can explain both the dip and bump in temperature, the primary source of uncertainty is confusion with polarization features created by a complex reionization history, which at most reduces the significance to 2.5 sigma for Planck and 5-6 sigma for an ideal experiment. Smoothing of the polarization spectrum by a large tensor component only slightly reduces the ability of polarization to test for inflationary features, as does requiring that polarization is consistent with the observed temperature spectrum given the expected low level of TE correlation on few-degree scales. A future polarization satellite would enable a decisive test of the feature hypothesis and provide complementary information about the shape of a possible step in the inflationary potential.

With a first order GSR approach the typical accuracy can be improved to better than the 5{\%} level. We illustrate this technique with the step potential model that has been invoked to explain the WMAP temperature power spectrum glitches at ell {\~{}} 20-40 and show that the maximum likelihood model falls short of observability by more than a factor of 100 in amplitude. We also explicitly demonstrate that the bispectrum consistency relation with the local slope of the power spectrum is satisfied for these models. In the GSR approach, the bispectrum arises from integrals of nearly the same function of the background slow-roll parameters as the power spectrum but with a stronger weight to the epoch before horizon crossing. Hence this technique enables reverse engineering of models with large bispectrum but small power spectrum features.},

@article{Achucarro2011,
	abstract = {The computation of the primordial power spectrum in multi-field inflation models requires us to correctly account for all relevant interactions between adiabatic and non-adiabatic modes around and after horizon crossing. One specific complication arises from derivative interactions induced by the curvilinear trajectory of the inflaton in a multi-dimensional field space. In this work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show that certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant imprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton trajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without interrupting slow roll), even in cases where the normal modes have masses approaching the cutoff of our theory. We emphasise that turning is defined with respect to the geodesics of the sigma model metric, irrespective of whether this is canonical or non-trivial. The imprints generically take the form of damped superimposed oscillations on the power spectrum. In the particular case of two-field models, if one of the fields is sufficiently massive compared to the scale of inflation, we are able to compute an effective low energy theory for the adiabatic mode encapsulating certain relevant operators of the full multi-field dynamics. As expected, a particular characteristic of this effective theory is a modified speed of sound for the adiabatic mode which is a functional of the background inflaton trajectory and the turns traversed during inflation. Hence in addition, we expect non-Gaussian signatures directly related to the features imprinted in the power spectrum.},

	abstract = {We describe the details of the binned bispectrum estimator as used for the official 2013 and 2015 analyses of the temperature and polarization CMB maps from the ESA Planck satellite. The defining aspect of this estimator is the determination of a map bispectrum (3-point correlator) that has been binned in harmonic space. For a parametric determination of the non-Gaussianity in the map (the so-called fNL parameters), one takes the inner product of this binned bispectrum with theoretically motivated templates. However, as a complementary approach one can also smooth the binned bispectrum using a variable smoothing scale in order to suppress noise and make coherent features stand out above the noise. This allows one to look in a model-independent way for any statistically significant bispectral signal. This approach is useful for characterizing the bispectral shape of the galactic foreground emission, for which a theoretical prediction of the bispectral anisotropy is lacking, and for detecting a serendipitous primordial signal, for which a theoretical template has not yet been put forth. Both the template-based and the non-parametric approaches are described in this paper.},
